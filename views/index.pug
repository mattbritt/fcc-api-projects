    h1 Free Code Camp API Projects
    p   This is a landing page for the FCC API Projects.

    h3 Timestamp
    p   The timestamp API can be reached at '/timestamp/' + either a natural language date (e.g. 'January 25th, 1990') or a unix timestamp (e.g. 1450137600).
    p   #[a(href='https://fcc-api-projects-matthewlbritt.c9users.io/timestamp/July 4, 1976') https://fcc-api-projects-matthewlbritt.c9users.io/timestamp/July 4, 1976]
    p   If a valid date is given, a json is returned with both the unix and natural language date:
    p=timestamp
    p  Otherwise both keys are null.
